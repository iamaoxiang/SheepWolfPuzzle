# SheepWolfPuzzle
#### you are a shepherd tasked with getting sheep and wolves across a river for some reason. If the wolves ever outnumber the sheep on either side of the river, the wolves will overpower and eat the sheep. You have a boat, which can only take one or two animals in it at a time, and must have at least one animal in it because youâ€™ll get lonely (and because the problem is trivial otherwise). How do you move all the animals from one side of the river to the other?

To run the code, simply download three .py files and run. The output is the route of optimal moves.
